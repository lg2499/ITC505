        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The Web 3.0 ecosystem is growing exponentially, which also adds to the cybersecurity concerns it imposes.
            There is a continuous shift in the Internet architecture, from a read/write model to a newer model known as Web 3.0.
            Global companies are exploring Web 3.0 opportunities in their business processes. Along with opportunities, Web 3.0 poses
            several cybersecurity risks to organizations that need to detect and mitigate efficiently. This work aims to identify
            solutions to the problem between the evolution of Web 3.0 and companies to evolve their infrastructures promptly to ensure
            the privacy and security of their data.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Web 3.0 marks a transition from static or user-generated content architectures (Web 1.0 and 2.0) to a more decentralized,
            semantic, and intelligent structure. In this model, machines will be able to interpret data; blockchains, edge computing,
            AI/ML, and user-controlled identity become more prominent. Though promising, these changes introduce novel cybersecurity
            challenges. The move toward decentralization and machine-readable semantics demands new defenses and risk mitigation strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Web Generations</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            Static content, mostly read-only interaction. Limited user input; servers delivered fixed pages.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            Increased interactivity with user-generated content (blogs, social media, wikis). Centralized platforms dominated, but risks
            such as identity theft, social engineering, and privacy issues emerged.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Decentralization through blockchain and distributed ledgers. Semantic web where data gains meaning, AI and edge computing
            empower machines to interpret context. Users gain more identity sovereignty, but new attack surfaces appear.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Cybersecurity Challenges in Web 3.0</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Authenticity:</strong> Ensuring integrity and validity in decentralized systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Threats:</strong> Risks with self-sovereign identities if authentication is weak.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Phishing and impersonation remain significant threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Increased complexity of protecting user data across decentralized nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>New Attack Vectors:</strong> Smart contract vulnerabilities, cryptojacking, consensus manipulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Adaptation Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zero-Trust Security Models</strong> – validate every access, no implicit trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Identity & Authentication</strong> – multi-factor and decentralized methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Layered Security & Monitoring</strong> – blockchain verification, anomaly detection, encryption.</li>
            <li><strong>User Education</strong> – awareness training for phishing and secure behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Standards & Regulation</strong> – formal guidelines for Web 3.0 security practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Web 3.0 offers immense promise—semantic internet, decentralization, and greater user empowerment. But these advances demand
            equally strong cybersecurity strategies. A secure Web 3.0 future depends on zero-trust models, advanced identity management,
            layered defenses, and a strong culture of awareness and regulation.

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            In structuring this paper in HTML, I used semantic tags for clarity and accessibility. 
            <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> presents the title and author details, while the paper content 
            resides in a main <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. Sections were divided with 
            <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for top-level headings and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for subsections 
            (e.g., Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0). Paragraphs were marked with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and 
            structured information like risks and strategies were represented with ordered/unordered lists 
            for readability. Italics (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) and bold (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>) were 
            used to emphasize references and key terms. Finally, I included the provided footer script 
            that automatically updates the last-modified date for compliance with the assignment instructions.
